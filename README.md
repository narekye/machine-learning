# first chapter - Intro to pandas

Basic concepts

```python

import pandas as pd
pd.__version__

```

The primary data structures in pandas are implemented as two classes: </br>

DataFrame, which you can imagine as a relational data table, with rows and named columns.
Series, which is a single column. A DataFrame contains one or more Series and a name for each Series.
The data frame is a commonly used abstraction for data manipulation. Similar implementations exist in Spark and R.
