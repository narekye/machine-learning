Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. Given a class variable y and a dependent feature vector x_1 through x_n, Bayes’ theorem states the following relationship:<img src="https://github.com/narekye/machine-learning/blob/master/udacity/udacity/data/naive_bayes_classifier.png" align="right" width="300px" height="300px" />
